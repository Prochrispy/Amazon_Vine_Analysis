# Summary 
  The video game industry is constantly trying to create the next greastest game. It is no surprise that paid programs from this industry will become for successful than unpaid based on there 5 star review. Paid programs will have more opportunities to create the next biggest video game than unpaid. In this analysis it is very clear there is bias towards paid progams. Another additional analysis could be preformed to prove this statement, such as reviewing the success pf5 star rating games between paid and unpaid.
